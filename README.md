 Simple app to help organize master's thesis folder.</br>
 
For Windows 10 only, as it uses win10toast.</br>
It automatically organize files inside chosen DIR into separate sub-folders for graphics, text and excel. Additionally it makes copy of (chosen) thesis main file.</br>
For same name error it put all files that cause conflict into separate sub-folder and inform about that via Windows 10 pop up notification.</br>
</br>
Known problems:</br>
1. try except with pass value, it's intentional (though not the cleanest solution),</br>
2. couple other aesthetic clean-up of code as a TODO in indefine future.
